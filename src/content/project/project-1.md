CounterStrikeSharp embeds the .NET runtime into a Counter-Strike 2 game server and provides a plugin API for interacting with the game server in various ways. 

Server moderators can install community created plugins to manage their server with functionality like admin systems, tournament organising tools & fun gamemodes amongst others.

- Listen to and respond to game events
- Add custom chat commands
- Manipulate players & props in the game world
- Reverse engineer server functionality & manipulate memory
